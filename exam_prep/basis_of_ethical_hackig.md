## Basis of ethical hacking


### Type of hackers and their motivations

#### Black hat
Coolness
Flexing skills
Money
Revenge
Powertrip
Protesting/activism
Organised crime

#### White hat
Help discover vulnerabilities
Understand systems
Fight crime
Create safer systems
Government employee

#### Script kiddies
Amateurs (Usually young kids) using publicly available software tools to attack
#### Protest hackers 
(Protest against something e.g. anonymous)
#### Grey hat hackers
Usually white hat, but can be black hat
#### Red hat hackers
Stopping black hat hackers by attacking them

### Differences between ethical and non-ethical hacking

non-ethical hackers does not care about the target, the goal is to complete the mission with whatever means necessary. When the mission is accomplished the mission is complete. Finds the easiest way in. Does not care if the system is harmed. Destroys and removes clues

ethical hackers usually are contracted or employed in some way by the target. Promtes security by documenting vulnerablities, without causing harm. Final presentation and report.

### The usual detailed steps of hacking

#### Information gathering
- General Information gathering
    Collect all available information on the target and systemize it
- Technical Information Gathering
    Collect network and system specific information like target IP ranges

#### Identifying the target domain
- Identify available host in the target network
    Which computers can be attacked
- Identify available services in the target network
    Which services can be attacked
- Manual mapping of the services
    Check how it looks, impression, system reactions, etc.

#### Finding vulnerabilities
- Automatic Vulnerability Scanning
    Intelligent tools with huge databases
- Manual verification of the findings
    Check that the findings are correct (true positives)

#### Exploiting vulnerabilities
- Exploit vulnerabilities using exploits

#### Lateral movements
- Lateral movements
    Move through the network
- Ensure access until the end of the project

#### Carry out the goal
- Collect info
    Achieve primary and secondary goals
- Remove clues
- Reporting and presentation
- Removing attacking files 
    Tools, data, scripts created during the penetration test

### Google hacking expressions and the type of information that can be obtained

subdomains
available files
services (through named subdomains)
new network ranges (though subdomains)
