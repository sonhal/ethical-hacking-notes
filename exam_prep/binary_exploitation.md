## Binary exploitation 1

### The Virtual Address Space and its content

### The stack frame and its content

### The parts of a stack overflow exploit

What are the parts of the stack overflow exploit?

Padding
return address
noopsled
payload - is the attack code to be executed like a reverse shell

### Return Oriented Programming, conditions for the gadgets

A gadget cannot have a jmp

## Binary exploitation 2

### The freelist and its usage

### The Virtual Method Table and its usage

What is the Virtual Method Table and why is it used? How can the attacker use it to exploit a software vulnerability?

VMT is a data structure used by OOP languages to make polymorphism possible it makes runtime resolution of methods possible. Object method addresses.

To override one of the method addresses. The attacker can place its own method to be executed.

### The use after free vulnerability and its exploitation

### Heap spraying

A payload delivery technique
