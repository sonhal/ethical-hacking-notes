## Binary exploitation 1

### The Virtual Address Space and its content
The Virtual Address Space is divided into kernel and user space. The user space consists of segments
- The code segment for the main executable
- Data segment for the global variables
- Stack segments for each thread
- Heap segment for dynamic memory allocations
- The dynamically loaded libraries (in case of dynamic linking)


### The stack frame and its content

The stack frame is a continuos block inside the the stack that stores the data of a function that was called(called) by the caller. When a function is called the caller or callee (depends on the calling convention) prepares the stack for the function execution. The stack frame contains the following data:

- Function parameters
    In order to pass parameter to the function the parameters are placed on the stack (with some calling conventions such as *fastcall* it is placed inside the registers).
- The return address of the method
    In order to be able to return to the place where the function is called, the return address is placed.
- The local variables
    Local variables of the function die after exiting the function so they are stored inside the stack frame.
- The saved base pointer
    To have a reference to the local variables, the top of the stack is saved to the base pointer and the previous base pointer is stored inside the stack frame.



### The parts of a stack overflow exploit

What are the parts of the stack overflow exploit?

Stack buffer overflow occurs when a local variable on the stack is overwritten. This is possible e.g when the size of the local variable is not considered therefore the return pointer of the stack frame can be modified by user controlled data

Padding
return address
noopsled
payload - is the attack code to be executed like a reverse shell

### Return Oriented Programming, conditions for the gadgets

A gadget cannot have a jmp

## Binary exploitation 2

### The freelist and its usage

### The Virtual Method Table and its usage

What is the Virtual Method Table and why is it used? How can the attacker use it to exploit a software vulnerability?

VMT is a data structure used by OOP languages to make polymorphism possible it makes runtime resolution of methods possible. Object method addresses.

To override one of the method addresses. The attacker can place its own method to be executed.

### The use after free vulnerability and its exploitation

### Heap spraying

A payload delivery technique
