# Lecture 11 - Social Engineering


## What is Social Engineering

Social Engineering is the manipulation of people to perform actions that lead to compromisation such as revealing confidential information.

- Information Gathering
- Fraud
- System Access
- Physical Access

## Basis of Social Engineering

- Human nature of trust
    People are usually positive to each other. People prefer to suppose the best.
- Trust based on the information provided
    Trust can be achieved by the information that is provided. If the attacker refers to something that is know by the target it can trigger trust in the target.
- Moral obligation
    To serve moral obligations can overwrite security policies. Like opening a dore for someone carrying heavy boxes
- Something promising
    By providing something promising people can be influenced to be less cautious.
- Confusion
    Provided misleading information. People feel stupid and thin it is their fault. They try to solve the situation and that will make them less cautious.
- Hurry
    Hurry makes people disposed to overlook details or make them less cautious.
- Ignorance
    Ignorant users easily overlook details or do not care about security at all
- Fear
    Fear has also negative effect on the security. It is harder to make decisions.
- Combination of the above
    Example: Trust based on provided info + hurry + fear
    *The CIO (name from info gathering) is furious about the …..(private story
revealed from info gathering) you should immediately provide your
credentials to check if it was you or not. If we can’t check it the CIO will …*


## Social Engineering techniques

- Impersonation
    - Posing as legitimate user
    - Posing as privileged user
- Eavesdropping
- Shoulder surfing
- Dumpster diving
- Piggybacking/Tailgating
    A person goes thorough a checkpoint and the attacker follows

## Computer based Social Engineering techniques

- Phishing
- Spear Phishing
- Fake software
    - Tool that has hidden function
    - Modified legitimate tool
    - Fake AV

## Phishing attacks

Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data. It ooccures when the attacker, masquerading as a trustet entity, dupes the target into open a email, message, document, etc. As a result some payload is downloaded and/or activated

## Spare Phishing

Spear Phishing is Phishing that targets a specific person or enterprise. It is a more in depth type of Phishing where the masquerade includes custom crafted information to gain the trust of the target.
